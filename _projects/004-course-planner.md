An application that helps you choose courses in a correct sequence to avoid missing pre-requisite courses.
This project is written in JavaScript using React.js and Node.js. <br>
Planning future semesters can be daunting when you have a lot of options.
But there is a very simple logic that dictates this process, and it does not work well when done manually.
This is why I decided to teach the computer the same process.
Now, all you need to do is enter the courses you wish to take and the pre-requisites for each of them and let the computer take care of the rest for you.
