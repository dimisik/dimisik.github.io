Yet another implementation of [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576v2.pdf){:target="_blank"} in TensorFlow. Using a pre-trained VGG 19 network, we can extract the (artistic) style from an image and combine it with the content from another image to generate a new "painting". The simple elegenace of this algorithm that manifests in its beautiful results blows me away, even after coding it from scratch.
