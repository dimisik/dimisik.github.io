This is a simple dungeon crawler game that I made for my Intro to Computing project. This game is written in C++ using SDL Libraries. <Br>
Ruins Escapade is a straightforward game where the player controls the hero who is trying to find his way back home through a labyrinth. <br>
I made this game in less than a week and it currently has only one level.
I am hoping to add more levels when I get the time.
