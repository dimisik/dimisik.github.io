This is a simple home server that requires minimal setup. Built upon a Raspberry Pi, the goal of this project was to build a server that is accessible and intuitive to the end user, who need not be a tech savvy. It can be used for a variety of purposes, such as cloud storage, automated backups, web hosting, etc. The server will also be accessible outside of the userâ€™s home network through an admin dashboard.
